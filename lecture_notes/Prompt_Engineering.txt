What is Prompt?
- A prompt is the input or instruction you give to an AI model (like me) to get a desired response.

Prompt Engineering
- The practice of designing and refining prompts to get the most accurate, useful, or creative responses from an AI model
- Principles: Keep prompts simple and clear, Provide context and examples, Break down complex tasks into smaller steps, Integrate external tools when needed, Test and refine prompts systematically
- Tips: Use role-playing to guide responses, Provide illustrative examples, Apply Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, Use formatting to distinguish different semantics， Incorporate emotional and material incentives
- CRIPSE: Capability and Role, Insight, Statement, Personality, Experiment
- Co-Star: Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, Response Format

Optimizing Prompts for Models with Reasoning Abilities
- For simple tasks, use non-reasoning models with concise prompts 
- Minimize unnecessary examples
- Define the model’s role and tone briefly
- Limit the level and depth of reasoning in the output, can ask for reasoning procedure
